## History 

The vision of robot army isnâ€™t a present day concept. The introduction of military robots is dated back from 1898 by the introduction of radio boats by Nicola Tesla. It was visualized by many visionaries in the last century. They were used by Germans and Russians in Second World War. Russians used Teletanks and Goliath were used by Germans. The Teletanks were equipped with DT machine guns, flamethrowers and smoke container to provide a smokescreen. The use of Goliath which is a mobile landmine in World War II by the Third Reich's forces also marked as a turning point in the history of military robots.[1]

## Existing Solution

UGVs i.e. Unmanned Ground Vehicle are those which attack from ground. They have various sensors, cameras, arms mounted on them. Robots like packbots are so compact, light and robust that army can carry them on their back. Controlled by a Pentium processor that has been designed specially to withstand rough treatment, Packbot's chassis has a GPS system, an electronic compass and temperature sensors built in. Packbot manufacturer iRobot says Packbot can move more than 8 mph (13 kph), can be deployed in minutes and can withstand a 6-foot (1.8-meter) drop on concrete -- the equivalent of 400 g's of force. Its design alows it to flip also.

### Talon robot

The other most popular robot is TALON. It is manufactured by Foster Miller. The TALON is a man-portable robot operating on small treads. It weighs less than 100 lbs (45 kg) in its base configuration. TALON is operated with a joystick control, has seven speed settings (top speed is 6 feet/1.8 meters per second) and can use its treads to climb stairs, maneuver through rubble and even take on snow.

Versatility has been designed into the TALON as well, with multiple possible configurations available that adapt the robot to the situation at hand. The basic TALON includes audio and video listening devices and a mechanical arm. A lightweight (60-lb/27-kg) version omits the arm. TALONs were used for search and rescue at WTC Ground Zero, and they have been used in Bosnia, Afghanistan and Iraq for the disposal of live grenades, improvised explosive devices and other dangerous explosives.[1]

## Missiles
In modern language, a missile, also known as a guided missile, is a guided self-propelled system, as opposed to an unguided self-propelled munition, referred to as a rocket (although these too can also be guided). Missiles have four system components: targeting or missile guidance, flight system, engine, and warhead. Missiles come in types adapted for different purposes: surface-to-surface and air-to-surface missiles (ballistic, cruise, anti-ship, anti-tank, etc.), surface-to-air missiles (and anti-ballistic), air-to-air missiles, and anti-satellite weapons. All known existing missiles are designed to be propelled during powered flight by chemical reactions inside a rocket engine, jet engine, or other type of engine. Non-self-propelled airborne explosive devices are generally referred to as shells and usually have a shorter range than missiles.[3]

Guided missiles have a number of different system components:
1.	Targeting or missile guidance
2.	Flight system
3.	Engine
4.	Warhead

### Guidance systems
  The most common method of guidance is to use some form of radiation, such as infrared, lasers or radio waves, to guide the missile onto its target. This radiation may emanate from the target (such as the heat of an engine or the radio waves from an enemy radar), it may be provided by the missile itself (such as a radar), or it may be provided by a friendly third party (such as the radar of the launch vehicle/platform, or a laser designator operated by friendly infantry). [3]






### Targeting systems
   Another method is to target the missile by knowing the location of the target and using a guidance system such as INS, TERCOM or satellite guidance. This guidance system guides the missile by knowing the missile's current position and the position of the target, and then calculating a course between them. This job can also be performed somewhat crudely by a human operator who can see the target and the missile and guide it using either cable- or radio-based remote control, or by an automatic system that can simultaneously track the target and the missile. Furthermore, some missiles use initial targeting, sending them to a target area, where they will switch to primary targeting, using either radar or IR targeting to acquire the target.[3]



### Flight system
   Whether a guided missile uses a targeting system, a guidance system or both, it needs a flight system. The flight system uses the data from the targeting or guidance system to maneuver the missile in flight, allowing it to counter inaccuracies in the missile or to follow a moving target. There are two main systems: vectored thrust (for missiles that are powered throughout the guidance phase of their flight) and aerodynamic maneuvering (wings, fins, canard (aeronautics), etc.).[3]

### Engine
   Missiles are powered by an engine, generally either a type of rocket engine or jet engine. Rockets are generally of the solid propellant type for ease of maintenance and fast deployment, although some larger ballistic missiles use liquid-propellant rockets. Jet engines are generally used in cruise missiles, most commonly of the turbojet type, due to its relative simplicity and low frontal area. Turbofans and ramjets are the only other common forms of jet engine propulsion, although any type of engine could theoretically be used. Long-range missiles may have multiple engine stages, particularly in those launched from the surface. These stages may all be of similar types or may include a mix of engine.[3]

### Warhead
   Missiles generally have one or more explosive warheads, although other weapon types may also be used. The warheads of a missile provide its primary destructive power (many missiles have extensive secondary destructive power due to the high kinetic energy of the weapon and unburnt fuel that may be on board). Warheads are most commonly of the high explosive type, often employing shaped charges to exploit the accuracy of a guided weapon to destroy hardened targets. [3]



## WEAPON ELEVATING MECHANISM

   A weapon elevating mechanism having an automatic clutch to lock the mecham at preselected elevation yet automatically release it for vertical movement upon actuation of the elevating input structure.

   Heretofore, difficulties have been encountered in precise aiming and locking of artillery weapons. Once an artillery weapon is aimed toward a target, it must be locked in position to prevent recoil forces from damaging the aiming mechanisms or altering the trajectory of a second projectile.The weight of the gun tube and other tipping parts could change the point of aim if not locked in position. An early type of elevation locking mechanism consisted of simply a pin which passed through spaced holes in adjacent parts of the cannon cradle.
   Commercially available automatic clutches have also been tried but are prone to slipping when used with larger caliber weapons. While these locking systems are capable of locking at virtually any angle of elevation, they do not meet modern requirements because of these disadvantages.The weapon elevating mechanism of the present invention utilizes an automatic clutch. The clutch releases automatically when the handwheel is rotated to raise or lower the weapon and engages automatically when rotation of the handwheel ceases.The clutch includes two or more plates having a large circular opening centrally located in each plate. These openings have ratchet teeth around their circumferences which are engaged by pawls in the clutch mechanism.
                 The teeth are staggered in each plate to allow more precise engagement of the clutch. Additional plates may be added if greater precision is required. The plates are positioned over a set of coaxial shafts. The inner shaft is an input or driving shaft and is connected, through a gear box, to the hand wheel. Initial rotation of the hand wheel causes the link to disengage the pawls from the ratchet teeth. Continued rotation of the hand wheel causes the output shaft to rotate with the input shaft. When the desired elevation is achieved the handwheel is released and the spring urges the pawls back into engagement with the ratchet teeth to lock the mechanism in place.[2]
## MULTI MISSILE LAUNCHER:
1.	Multi-Mission Launcher, or MML, is a weapon used as part of a Soldier protection system called Integrated Fire Protection Capability.
2.	The MML launcher can rotate 360 degrees and elevate from 0-90 degrees in order to identify. The and knock out approaching fire from any direction or angle.
3.	The Multi-Missile Launcher is capable of firing both short-range missiles and long-range missiles, including any special munitions designed for them, as well as use the Artemis IV fire control system. Originally designed by members of the Battle Magic mercenary unit in 3067, the MML helps simplify logistical needs of cash-strapped mercenaries, while simultaneously allowing them to take maximum advantage of special munitions.[4]
4.	The Multi-Missile Launcher (MML) is a state of the  art rail launcher  capable  of carring a range  of  different  missiles  with  out the  need for role change. Auniquemodular construction allows the MML to interface with short, medium and beyond visual range missiles. A B O L counter measures dispensing system may be carried for additional operational flexibility.[4]

## TERRAIN
Terrain or relief (also topographical relief) involves the vertical and horizontal dimensions of land surface. Terrain is militarily critical because it determines the ability of armed forces to take and hold areas, and move troops and material into and through areas. An understanding of terrain is basic to both defensive and offensive strategy.
Terrain is important in determining weather patterns. Two areas geographically close to each other may differ radically in precipitation levels or timing because of elevation differences or a "rain shadow" effect.
Precise knowledge of terrain is vital in aviation, especially for low-flying routes and maneuvers (see terrain collision avoidance) and airport altitudes. Terrain will also affect range and performance of radars and terrestrial radio navigation systems. Furthermore, a hilly or mountainous terrain can strongly impact the implementation of a new aerodrome and the orientation of its runways.[5]
